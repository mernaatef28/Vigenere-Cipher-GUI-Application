This project provides a simple and user-friendly GUI application for encrypting and decrypting text files using the Vigenere Cipher Algorithm. 

## Features
- **Encrypt Text Files**: Select a text file and a key to encrypt the file. The encrypted file is saved as 'encrypted_file.txt'.
- **Decrypt Text Files**: Select an encrypted text file and the original key to decrypt the file. The decrypted file is saved as 'decrypted_file.txt'.

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script to launch the GUI application.
2. Enter your key in the provided text box.
3. Click on 'Encrypt File' to select a text file to encrypt. The encrypted file will be saved as 'encrypted_file.txt'.
4. Click on 'Decrypt File' to select an encrypted text file to decrypt. The decrypted file will be saved as 'decrypted_file.txt'.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- tkinter
- numpy

## Future Work
- Extend the application to support other file types.
- Implement additional cipher algorithms.
